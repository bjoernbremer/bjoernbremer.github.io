I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences/Index.aspx) at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx") and a Doctoral Researcher in the [POLCON project]("http://www.eui.eu/Projects/POLCON/Home.aspx).

I previously studied at [UWC Atlantic College](http://www.atlanticcollege.org/) and I hold degrees in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) and in International Relations and International Economics from the [School of Advanced International Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/) (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University.

My main research interests lie at the intersection of political economy, comparative politics, and political behaviour. In my PhD, I studied the fiscal policies of social democratic parties in response to the Great Recession.

I collect news about my research, blog articles, and other thoughts about politics and economics [here]({{ site.url }}/blog). For more recent updates, feel free to browse my twitter timeline:
