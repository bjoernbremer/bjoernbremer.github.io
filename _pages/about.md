I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.ceu.edu/) at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/) (CEU) in Vienna. 

Previously, I was a John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow at the [Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/) (CES) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and a Senior Researcher in Comparative and International Political Economy at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de/2733/en) (MPIfG) in Cologne. I completed my PhD in Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/home) (EUI) in Florence. Prior to my Ph.D., I studied at [UWC Atlantic College](http://www.atlanticcollege.org/) and obtained a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) and an MA in International Relations and International Economics from the [School of Advanced International Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/) (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University.

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, international political economy, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in the politics of macroeconomic policies, European integration, climate change, and the political consequences of economic crises. My first book, “[Austerity from the Left: Social Democratic Parties in the Shadow of the Great Recession](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/austerity-from-the-left-9780192872210)”, was published by Oxford University Press in 2023.
