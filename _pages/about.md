I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.ceu.edu/) at [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu/) (CEU) in Vienna. 

Previously, I was a John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow at the [Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/) (CES) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and a Senior Researcher in Comparative and International Political Economy at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de/2733/en) (MPIfG) in Cologne. I completed my PhD in Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/home) (EUI) in Florence. 

Prior to my PhD, I studied at [UWC Atlantic College](http://www.atlanticcollege.org/) and earned a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) and an MA in International Relations and International Economics from the [School of Advanced International Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/) (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University.

My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, international political economy, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in the politics of fiscal and monetary policy, the political economy of climate change and the green transition, European integration, and the electoral consequences of economic crises.

My first book, “[Austerity from the Left: Social Democratic Parties in the Shadow of the Great Recession](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/austerity-from-the-left-9780192872210)”, was published by Oxford University Press in 2023.

I am currently writing another book with [Lucio Baccaro](https://www.mpifg.de/baccaro_en) on the politics of stagnation and reform in the eurozone, which examines how different growth models shape political conflicts over economic policy. It is under advanced contract with Princeton University Press.
