<p>The core of my research concerns two broad areas: party competition, and protest politics. In addition, I work on voting behavior, and the extent to which patterns of voting have changed during the Great Recession. The level of analysis varies between individual citizens and protest/party organizations. Most of it takes a comparative European perspective, but in some of my work I focus on the politics of my home country, Romania. The pages below are not exhaustive but should give an impression of my on-going work.</p>
