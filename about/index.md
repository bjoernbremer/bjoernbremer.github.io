I am currently a PhD Candidate at the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx) in Florence and a doctoral researcher in the ERC funded research project  [POLCON](http://www.eui.eu/Projects/POLCON/Home.aspx). My doctoral research focuses on the response of social democratic parties to the Great Recession.

I previously studied at [UWC Atlantic College](http://www.atlanticcollege.org/) before I obtained my Bachelor in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). Afterwards I pursued a Master’s degree in International Relations and International Economics at the [School of Advanced International Studies](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/) (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University. For my Master’s, I concentrated in European Studies and worked towards a specialisation in Economic Theory and Quantitative Methods. 

At SAIS I worked as a research assistant for Professor [David P. Calleo](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/david-calleo), Professor [Matthias M. Matthijs](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/matthias-matthijs), and at the [Center for Transatlantic Relations](http://www.transatlanticrelations.org/) in Washington, DC. I was also a teaching assistant for a graduate-level course in comparative politics.

During the summer of 2013, I worked as a research intern at the [German Institute for Economic Research](https://www.diw.de/en) (DIW) in Berlin, where I was involved in a research project on the lack of investments in Germany. Moreover, I conducted research on the scope of Germany’s net international investment losses from 2005 to 2012. 

My main research interests include political economy, comparative politics, the politics of economic crises, political parties, and public opinion.
