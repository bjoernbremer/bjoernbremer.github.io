*We are pleased to announce the launch of the Max Planck Online Workshop in Comparative Political Economy (MAX CPE), a new monthly online seminar series in comparative political economy hosted by the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies.*

Inspired by the success of online seminars in neighboring fields, MAX CPE aims to foster exchanges, connections, and conversations in the global community of scholars of comparative political economy (CPE) and beyond. MAX CPE will provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of new research in CPE, taking advantage of the online format to transcend the usual territorial boundaries even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. 

MAX CPE is coordinated by Arianna Tassinar, Lucio Baccaro, and myself. We invite proposals for paper presentations from scholars working on all aspects of comparative political economy broadly defined. We are committed to the principles of methodological and theoretical pluralism, and we especially encourage contributions from early career scholars, women, people of colour, and other under-represented groups in the discipline.

Seminars will take place online on a monthly basis, starting in January 2021. Please more information and the call for papers following [here](https://www.mpifg.de/projects/max-cpe/index_en.asp). You can also sign up to our mailing list to receive further information about upcoming seminars [here](https://www.mpifg.de/projects/max-cpe/signup-form.asp).

We would be grateful if you could circulate this announcement among your networks and consider submitting a paper proposal by November 30, 2020 by emailing [maxcpe@mpifg.de](mailto:maxcpe@mpifg.de).
