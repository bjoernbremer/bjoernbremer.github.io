*I had the pleasure to talk to [Tarik Abou-Chadi](https://www.tarikabouchadi.net/) about my research on social democratic parties and austerity for the Transformation of European Politics Podcast.*

In the podcast series, Tarik talks to other political scientists about publications that help to better understand the Transformation of European Politics in the past 20 years. The podcasts relate these academic publications to broader debates within political science and current political developments. 

Listen to my conversation with Tarik [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-467531770/episode-17-bjorn-bremer-austerity-politics) and check out all the other wonderful podcasts that are part of the series.
