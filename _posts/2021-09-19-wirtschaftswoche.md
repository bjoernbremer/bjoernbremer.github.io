The German magazine [WirtschaftsWoche](https://www.wiwo.de/) published a fantastic piece about findings from our research project on the determinants of local public investment in Germany that I am working on with Donato di Carlo and Leon Wansleben. The article is available [here](https://www.wiwo.de/technologie/digitalisierung-der-wirtschaft/investitionssummen-aller-401-kreise-wo-sich-der-investitionsstau-seit-der-wiedervereinigung-am-meisten-verschaerft-hat-/27619494.html). It was written by Jannik Deters, and it is based on our recent [MPIfG Discussion Paper](https://www.mpifg.de/discussion-papers).
