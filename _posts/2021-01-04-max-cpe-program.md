*We are pleased to announce the program of the Max Planck Online Workshop in Comparative Political Economy (MAX CPE), a new monthly online seminar series in comparative political economy hosted by the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies.*

Inspired by the success of online seminars in neighboring fields, MAX CPE aims to foster exchanges, connections, and conversations in the global community of scholars of comparative political economy (CPE) and beyond. MAX CPE will provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of new research in CPE, taking advantage of the online format to transcend the usual territorial boundaries even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. 

MAX CPE is coordinated by Arianna Tassinar, Lucio Baccaro, and myself. Seminars will take place online on a monthly basis and the full program is available here: Please more information and the call for papers following [here](https://www.mpifg.de/projects/max-cpe/index_en.asp). You can also sign up to our mailing list to receive further information about upcoming seminars [here](https://www.mpifg.de/projects/max-cpe/signup-form.asp).
