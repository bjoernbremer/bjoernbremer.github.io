# Welcome to my personal page

This is the code for my personal page, available at: <a href="http://www.endre-borbath.eu/" target="_blank">endre-borbath.eu</a>

It is based on <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io" target="_blank">Academic Pages</a>, which in turn is based on the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme</a>, Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. 

I tweaked the template, but since none of that is documented, I recommend using the original repositories above.

Let me know if I can be of any help!
