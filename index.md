I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Social and Political Sciences](http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences/Index.aspx) at the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx) and a Doctoral Researcher in the [POLCON](http://www.eui.eu/Projects/POLCON/Home.aspx) project. I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/bjoern_bremer) and collect news about my research, blog articles, and other thoughts about politics and economics <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.
