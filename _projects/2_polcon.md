I was a member of the ERC-funded research project [POLCON](http://www.eui.eu/Projects/POLCON/Home.aspx), which studied the political consequences of the Great Recession. The project combined a comparative-static analysis of 30 European countries with a dynamic analysis of political conflict in 12 countries. For this purpose, we studied both elections and political protest in the shadow of the Great Recession and analyzed the issue-specific public interaction between both political arenas. The key question that the project addressed was whether the Great Recession changed the long-term trends of political conflict in Europe. For this purpose, we utilized survey data as well as original content anlysis of protest events, election campaigns, and issue-specific public contestations.

In co-authored papers, I worked on different aspects of this research project. On the one hand, I worked on comparative-static analyses of the electoral consequences of the Great Recession. I was responsible for the analysis of the consequences of the economic crisis on protest and electoral politics and the interaction of both. To better understand these consequences, I also zoomed in and studied the political consequences of specific economic policies during the Great Recession, namely austerity and structural reforms. On the other hand, I analyzed the development of political conflicts in comparative case studies. In particular, I have worked on chapters in edited volumes that studied the development of political conflicts in the context of the crisis in Germany, Greece, Spain, and the UK.
